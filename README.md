# AI Cursor

AI Cursor is a Python-powered desktop automation tool that uses OCR and natural language processing to control your screen intelligently. It reads visible text, locates UI elements like buttons, and performs clicks or typing based on your commands‚Äîjust like a human would, without needing HTML or DOM access.

## Features

- **Natural Language Control**: Control your system using plain English commands
- **System Information**: Get system info in conversational language, like talking to your PC
- **Gmail Integration**: Send emails through an interactive prompt interface
- **WhatsApp Automation**: Send WhatsApp messages by automating WhatsApp Web
- **OCR-Powered UI Detection**: Uses Tesseract OCR to detect and interact with UI elements
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any desktop environment with visual elements

## Technologies Used

- **Python** - Core programming language
- **PyAutoGUI** - Cursor automation and screen control
- **OpenCV** - Image processing and computer vision
- **pytesseract** - OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for text detection
- **webbrowser** - Opening web applications like WhatsApp Web
- **time** - Managing delays and timing
